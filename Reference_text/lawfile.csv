Abstract  
 
This paper  is the first chapter of the third edition of The Anatomy of Corporate Law: A 
Comparative and Functional Approach , by Reini er Kraakman, John Armour, Paul 
Davies, Luca Enriques, Henry Hansmann, Gerard Hertig, Klaus Hopt, Hideki Kanda 
Mariana Pargendler, Georg Ringe, and Edward Rock (Oxford University Press, 
2017). The book as a whole provides a functional analysis of corporate (or company) 
law in Europe, the U.S., and Japan. Its organization reflects the structure of corporate 
law across all jurisdictions, while individual chapters explore the diversity of 
jurisdictional approaches to the common problems of corporate law. In its  third 
edition, the book has been significantly revised and expanded.  
As the introductory  chapter to the book, this paper introduces the book’s analytic 
framework, which focuses on the common structure of corporate law across different 
jurisdictions as a r esponse to fundamentally similar legal and economic problems. It 
first details the economic importance of the corporate form’s hallmark features: legal 
personality, limited liability, transferable shares, delegated management, and investor 
ownership. The m ajor agency problems that attend the corporate form and that, 
therefore, must be addressed, are identified. The chapter next considers the role of 
law and contract in structuring corporate affairs, including the function of mandatory 
and default rules, sta ndard forms, and choice of law, as well the debate about the 
proper role of corporate law in promoting overall social welfare. While almost all legal 
systems retain the core features of the corporate form, individual jurisdictions have 
made distinct choice s regarding many other aspects of their corporate laws. The 
forces shaping the development of corporate law, including evolving patterns of 
share ownership, are examined.

1.1 Introduction  
What is the common  structure  of corporate ( or company ) law across different 
jurisdictions? Although this question is rarely asked by corporate law scholars, 
it is critically important for the comparative investigation of the subject . 
Existing  scholarship often emphasizes the divergence among European, 
American, Japanese , and emerging  market corporations in terms of corporate 
governance, share ownership, capital markets, and business culture.1 But, 
despite  the very real differences across jurisdictions along these dimensions, 
the underlying uniformity of the corporate form is at least as  impressive. 
Business corporations have a fundamentally similar set of legal 
characteristics —and face a fundamentally similar set of legal problems —in all 
jurisdictions.  
Consider, in this regard, the basic legal characteristics of the business 
corporation.  To anticipate our discussion below, there are five of these 
characteristics, most of which will be easily recognizable to anyone familiar 
with business affairs. They are: legal personality, limited liability, transferable 
shares, delegated management unde r a board structure, and investor 
ownership. These characteristics respond —in ways we will explore —to the 
economic exigencies of the large modern business enterprise. Thus, 
corporate law everywhere must, of necessity, provide for them. To be sure, 
there ar e other forms of business enterprise that lack one or more of these 
characteristics. But the remarkable fact —and the fact that we wish to stress —
is that, in market economies, almost all large -scale business firms adopt a 
legal form that possesses all five of the basic characteristics of the business 
corporation. Indeed, most small jointly  owned firms adopt this corporate form 
as well, although sometimes with deviations from one or more of the five basic 
characteristics to fit their special needs.  
It follows  that a principal function of corporate law is to provide 
business enterprises with a legal form that possesses these five core 
attributes. By making this form widely available and user -friendly, corporate 
law enables business participants  to transact easi ly through the medium of 
the corporate entity, and thus lowers the costs of conducting business. Of 
course, the number of provisions that the typical corporation statute devotes

 to defining the corporate form is likely to be only a small part of the statut e as 
a whole.2 Nevertheless, these are the provisions that comprise t he legal core  
of corporate law that is shared by every jurisdiction. In this chapter, we briefly 
explore the contracting efficiencies that accompany these five features of the 
corporate f orm, and that, we believe, have helped to propel the worldwide 
diffusion of the corporate form.  
However, our principal focus  in this book is not on the basic attributes 
that define the corporate form . Rather, it is on a second, equally important 
function o f corporate law: namely, reducing the ongoing costs of organizing 
business through the corporate form . Corporate  law does this by facilitating 
coordination between participants in corporate enterprise, and by reducing 
the scope for value -reducing forms of opportunism among different 
constituencies. As we outline in Section 1.2, corporate laws everywhere 
share core features which can be understood as serving to reduce the costs 
for participants of organizing their activities in business firms.3 
Most of corpo rate law can be understood as responding to three 
principal sources of opportunism  that are endemic to such organization : 
conflicts between managers and shareholders, conflicts between controlling 
and non -controlling shareholders , and conflicts between sha reholders and 
the corporation’s other contractual counterparties , including particularly 
creditors and employees. All three of these generic conflicts may usefully be 
characterized as what economists call ‘agency problems.’ Chapter 2 
examines these three a gency problems, both in general and as they arise in 
the corporate context, and surveys the range of legal strategies that can be 
employed to tackle  those problems.  
The reader might object that these three types of coordination costs 
and agency conflicts a re not uniquely ‘corporate’. After all, any form of jointly  
owned enterprise faces coordination costs and engenders  conflicts among its 
owners, managers, and third -party contractors. We agree; insofar as the 
corporation is only one of several legal forms f or the joint ly owned firm, it 
faces the same generic functional challenges  that confront all joint ly owned 
firms. Nevertheless, the particular characteristics of the corporate form matter 
a great deal, since it is the form chosen by most large -scale enterp rises —and, 
as a practical matter, the only form that firms with widely dispersed ownership 
can choose in many jurisdictions.4 In our view, this is because its particular 
characteristics make it uniquely effective at minimizing coordination costs. 
Moreover,  these same  features determine the particular contours of its 
                                                           
2 We use the term ‘corporation statute’ to refer to the general law that governs corporations, 
and not to a corporation’s individual charter (or ‘articles of incorporation’, as that document is 
sometimes also called).  
3 These include  the costs of searching for contracting partners  and negotiating and drafting 
the relevant agreements . Although such costs are often referred to as ‘transaction costs’, we 
eschew this term because it is also used more broadly in other contexts, rendering it a fertile 
source of co nfusion.  
4 This is because in most jurisdictions, only firms taking the corporate form may raise equity 
finance from capital markets . However, there are exceptions to this general proposition. F or 
example , in the U.S., the equity securities of so -called ‘master’ lim ited partnerships and 
limited liability companies may be registered for public trading.  "

 agency problems. To take an obvious example, the fact that shareholders 
enjoy limited liability —while, say, general partners in a partnership do not —
has traditionally made creditor protection fa r more salient in corporate law 
than it is in partnership law. Similarly, the fact that corporate investors may 
trade their shares is the foundation of the anonymous trading stock market —
an institution that has encouraged the separation of ownership from c ontrol, 
and so has sharpened the management -shareholder agency problem.  
In this book, we explore the role of corporate law in minimizing 
coordination and agency problems —and thus, making the corporate form 
practicable —in the most important categories of co rporate actions and 
decisions. More particularly, Chapters 3  to 9 address seven categories of 
transactions and decisions that involve the corporation, its owners, its 
managers, and the other parties with whom it deals. Most of these categories 
of firm acti vity are, again, generic, rather than uniquely corporate. For 
example, Chapters 3 and 4 address governance mechanisms that operate 
over the firm’s ordinary business decisions, whil e Chapter 5 turns to the 
checks that operate on the corporation’s transactio ns with creditors. As before, 
however, although similar agency problems arise in similar contexts across all 
forms of joint ly owned enterprise, the response of corporate law turns in part 
on the unique legal features that characterize the corporate form.  
Taken together, the latter seven chapters of our book cover nearly all 
of the important prob lems in corporate law. In each c hapter, we describe how 
the basic  coordination costs and  agency problems of the corporate form 
manifest themselves in a given categor y of corporate activity, and then 
explore the range of alternative legal responses that are available. We 
illustrate these alternative approaches with examples from the corporate law s 
of various prominent jurisdictions. We explore the patterns of homogenei ty 
and heterogeneity that appear. Where there are significant differences across 
jurisdictions, we seek to address both the sources and the consequences of 
those differences. Our examples are drawn principally from a handful of major 
representative jurisdi ctions,  which we label our ‘core jurisdictions’. These are  
Brazil , France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the U.S.,  though we 
sometimes  make incidental reference to the laws of other jurisdictions to 
make particular  points.  We do not —and cannot, in a s hort book —attempt to 
be comprehensive in our coverage of the substantive law; rather we make 
reference to the laws of these jurisdictions as appropriate to illustrate and 
develop analytic propositions. In focusing on the jurisdictions we know best, 
an elem ent of subjectivity is of course introduced. This reflects a heuristic 
endeavor on our part: the goal is not so much to provide a definitive account 
of corporate laws anywhere (let alone everywhere), but a common language 
for understanding them.  
In emphas izing a strongly functional approach to the issues of 
comparative law, this book differs from some of the more traditional 
comparative law scholarship, both in the field of corporate law and 
elsewhere.5 We join an emerging tendency in comparative law schol arship by

 seeking to give a highly integrated view of the role and structure of corporate 
law that provides a clear framework within which to organize an 
understanding of individual systems, both alone and in comparison with each 
other.6 Moreover, while co mparative law scholarship often has a tendency to 
emphasize differences between jurisdictions, our approach is to highlight  
similarities  as well . Doing so illuminates an und erlying commonality of 
structure that transcends national boundaries. It also provi des an important 
perspective on the basis for the international cross -fertilization  of corporate 
law that has become more common in the wake of the growth of global 
economic activity.   
We realize that the term ‘functional’, which we have used here and in 
our title, means different things to different people, and that some of the uses 
to which that term has been put in the past —particularly in the field of 
sociology —have made it justifiably suspect. It would perhaps be more 
accurate to call our approach ‘eco nomic’ rather than ‘functional’, though the 
sometimes tendentious use of economic argumentation in legal literature to 
support particular (generally laissez -faire) policy positions, as well as the 
tendency in economic analysis to neglect non -pecuniary moti vations or 
assume an unrealistic degree of rationality in human action, have also caused 
many scholars —particularly outside the United States —to be as wary of 
‘economic analysis’ as they are of ‘functional analysis’. For the purposes at 
hand, however, we n eed not commit ourselves on fine points of social science 
methodology. We need simply note that the exigencies of commercial activity 
and organization present practical problems that are rough ly similar in market 
economies throughout the world. Our analysi s is ‘functional’ in the sense that 
we organize discussion around the ways in which corporate laws respond to 
these problems, and the various forces that have led different jurisdictions to 
choose roughly similar —though by no means always the same —solution s to 
them.  
That is not to say that our objective here is just to explore the 
commonality of corporate law across jurisdictions. Of equal importance, we 
wish to offer a common language  and a general analytic framework  with 
which to understand the purposes t hat can potentially be served by corporate 
law, and with which to compare and evaluate the efficacy of different legal 
regimes in serving those purposes.7 Indeed, it is our hope that the analysis 
offered in this book will be of use not only to students of comparative law, but 
also to those who simply wish to have a more solid framework within which to 
view their own country’s corporation law.  
                                                           
6 Other examples of this approach include John Armour et al., PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL 
REGULATION (2016); Gregor B achmann et al., REGULATING THE CLOSED CORPORATION  (2012); 
Curtis Milhaupt and  Katharina Pistor, LAW AND CAPITALISM  (2008) .  
7 In very general terms, our approach echoes that taken by Robert Clark in his important 
treatise, CORPORATE LAW (1986), and Frank Easterbrook and Daniel Fischel, in their 
discussion of U.S. law,  THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURE OF CORPORATE LAW (1991). However, our 
analysis differs from —and goes beyond —that offered by these and other commentators in 
several key respects. Most obviously, we both present a comparative analysis that addresses 
the corporate law of multiple jurisdictions and provide an integrated functional overview that 
stresses the agency problems at the core of corporate law, rather than focusing on more 
particular legal institutions and solutions.  "
" 
 Nor does emphasizing similarities in underlying structure mean 
ignoring differences between countries’ corporate law s. Even if, as we think, 
corporate laws everywhere respond to similar economic problems, there may 
be differences in the way they do so, often reflecting local variety in the way 
other aspects of the system of economic production are organized.8 The basis 
for such differences in corporate law rules is consequently illuminated by 
reference to the broader economic environment. Yet in other cases, 
differences may result from the various concerns of domestic politics  over 
distribution or from diverse interest g roup dynamics. Our unitary account 
cannot explain the presence of such differences, but it does have implications 
for their persistence. To the extent that such matters impede corporate law’s 
ability to respond to economic exigencies, they will in time fac e economically 
motivated pressure for reform.  
That said , we take no strong stand here in the enduring debate on the 
extent to which corporate law is or should be ‘converging’, much less on to 
what it might converge.9 That is a subject on which reasonable m inds 
(including, indeed, the authors of this book) can reasonably disagree .10 
Rather, we are seeking to set out a conceptual framework and a factual basis 
with which that and other important issues facing corporate law can be 
fruitfully explored.  
1.2 What Is a Corporation?  
As anticipated , the five core structural characteristics of the business 
corporation are: (1) legal personality, (2) limited liability, (3) transferable 
shares, (4) centralized management under a board structure, and (5) shared 
owne rship by contributors of equity capital. In virtually all economically 
important jurisdictions, there is a basic statute that provides for the formation 
of firms with all of these characteristics. As this pattern suggests, these 
characteristics have strong ly complementary qualities for many firms. 
Together, they make the corporation especially  attractive for organizing 
productive activity. But these characteristics also generate tensions and 
tradeoffs that lend a distinctively corporate character to the age ncy problems 
that corporate law must address.

 1.2.1  Legal personality  
In the economics literature, a firm is often characterized as a ‘nexus of 
contracts’.11 As commonly used, this description is ambiguous. It is often 
invoked simply to emphasize that most of the important relationships within a 
firm—including, in particular, those among the firm’s owners, managers, and 
employees —are essentially contractual in character. This is an important 
insight, but it does not distinguish firms from other networks of c ontractual 
relationships. It is perhaps more accurate to describe a firm as a ‘nexus for 
contracts’, in the sense that a firm serves, fundamentally, as the common 
counterparty in numerous contracts with suppliers, employees, and 
customers, coordinating the  actions of these multiple persons through 
exercise of its contractual rights. The first and most important contribution of 
corporate law, as of other forms of organizational law, is to permit a firm to 
serve this coordinating role by operating  as a single  contracting party that is 
distinct from the various individuals who own or manage the firm. In so doing, 
it enhances the ability of these individuals to engage together in joint projects.  
The core element of the firm as a nexus for contracts is what civil  
lawyers refer to as ‘separate patrimony’. This involves the demarcation of a 
pool of assets that are distinct from other assets owned, singly or jointly, by 
the firm’s owners (the shareholders),12 and of which the firm itself, acting 
through its designated  managers, is viewed in law as being the owner. The 
firm’s entitlements  of ownership over its designated assets include the rights 
to use the assets, to sell them, and —of particular importance —to make them 
available for attachment by its creditors. Convers ely, because these assets 
are conceived as belonging to the firm, rather than the firm’s owners, they are 
unavailable  for attachment by the owners’ personal creditors. The core 
function of this separate patrimony has been termed ‘ entity  shielding ’, to 
emph asize that it involves shielding the assets of the entity —the 
corporation —from the creditors of the entity’s owners.13 
Entity shielding involves two relatively distinct rules of law. The first is a 
priority rule that grants to creditors of the firm, as secu rity for the firm’s debts, 
a claim on the firm’s assets that is prior to the claims of the personal creditors 
of the firm’s owners. This rule is shared by modern legal forms for enterprise 
                                                           
11 The c haracterization of a firm as a ‘nexus of contracts’ originates with Michael Jensen and 
William Meckling, Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership 
Structure , 3 JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS 305 (1976), building on Armen Alchian a nd 
Harold Demsetz, Production, Information Costs, and Economic Organization , 62 AMERICAN 
ECONOMIC REVIEW 777 (1972).  
12 We use the term ‘owners’ simply to refer to the group who have the entitlement to control 
the firm’s assets. For an account of how this relates to the legal concept of ‘ownership’ see 
John Armour and Michael J. Whincop, The Proprietary Foundations of Corp orate Law , 27 
OXFORD JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES  429, 436 -448 (2007).  
13 The term ‘entity shielding’ derives from Henry Hansmann, Reinier Kraakman, and Richard 
Squire, Law and the Rise of the Firm , 119 HARVARD LAW REVIEW  1333 (2006). The centrality 
of entity s hielding to organizational law is explored in Henry Hansmann and Rei nier 
Kraakman, The Essential Role of Organizational Law , 110 YALE LAW JOURNAL 387 (2000), 
where this same attribute was labelled ‘affirmative asset partitioning’.  "

 organization, including partnerships.14 The consequence of this prio rity rule is 
that a firm’s assets are, as a default rule of law,15 automatically made 
available for the enforcement of contractual liabilities entered into in the name 
of the firm. 16 By thus bonding the firm’s contractual commitments, the rule 
makes these c ommitments credible.  
The second component of entity shielding —a rule of ‘liquidation 
protection’ —provides that the individual owners of the corporation (the 
shareholders) cannot withdraw their share of firm assets at will, nor can the 
personal creditors of  an individual owner foreclose on the owner’s share of firm 
assets.17 Such withdrawal or foreclosure would force partial or complete 
liquidation of the firm . So the liquidation protection rule serves to protect the 
going concern value of the firm against de struction by individual shareholders 
or their creditors.18 In contrast to the priority rule just discussed , it is not found 
in some other standard legal forms for enterprise organization, such as the 
partnership.19 Legal entities, such as the business corpor ation, that are 
characterized by both these rules —priority for business creditors and 
liquidation protection —can therefore be thought of as having ‘strong form’ 
entity shielding, as opposed to the ‘weak form’ entity shielding found in 
partnerships, which a re usually characterized only by the priority rule and not 
by liquidation protection.  By isolating the value of the firm from the personal 
financial affairs of the firm’s owners , strong form entity shielding facilitates 
tradability of the firm’s shares, wh ich is the third characteristic of the corporate 
form. 20  
The benefits of these two rules —creditor priority and liquidation 
protection —reinforce one another where the ‘assets’ in question comprise 
                                                           
14 While even unregistered  common law partnerships are subject to this priority rule, many 
civil law jurisdictions recognize a class of unregistered ‘partnerships’ that lack this rule of 
priority. In effect, such partnerships are just special forms for the joint management  of ass ets 
rather than distinct entiti es for purposes of contracting.  
15 On default rules, see Section 1.4.1.  
16 The effect is the same as if the firm’s owners had themselves entered into a joint contract 
and granted non -recourse security over certain personal assets  to the counterparty, as 
opposed to transferring those assets to the corporate entity, and then procuring the company 
to enter into the contract.

19 That said , it is possible in many jurisdictions to effect liquidation protection by agreement 
amongst the owners of a partnership.  
20 While strong form entity shielding seems essential for free tradability of shares (see 
Hansmann and Kraakman, note 13), limited liability does not: so long as shareholder liability 
for a firm’s debts is pro rata rather than joint and several, free tradability of shares is feasible 
with unlimited personal shareholder liability  for corporate debts:  see Henry Hansmann and 
Reinier Kraakman, Toward Unlimited Shareholder Liability for Corporate Torts , 100 YALE LAW

 contractual agreements.21 An increasingly important part of a firm’s value 
creation comes from the interaction of the various contracts it has negotiated. 
These two rules assure counterparties that their performance will be delivered 
by reference to the value generated by that bundle  of contracts and the 
associated  assets, amongst which there will typically be complementarities. 
Not only does this make it easier to negotiate such contracts, but it also 
facilitates liquidity on the part of shareholders. It is far easier for the owner of a 
corporation to transfer her shares than it would be for a sole proprietor to 
transfer her contracts.  
For a firm to serve effectively as a contracting party, two other types of 
rules are also needed. First, there must be rules specifying to third parties the 
individuals who have autho rity to buy and sell assets in the name of the firm, 
and to enter into contracts that are bonded by those assets.22 While  
participants in a firm are to a large extent free to specify the delegation of 
authority by contract amongst themselves, background rul es are needed —
beyond such contractual agreement —to deal with situations where agents 
induce third parties to rely on the mere appearance of their authority. Such 
rules differ according to organizational form. The particular rules of authority 
governing the  corporation are treated below as a separate core characteristic, 
‘delegated management’. They provide  that a subset of corporate managers 
(such as the board of directors or certain officers) , as opposed to individual 
owners, has power to bind the company in contract.23 
Second, there must be rules specifying the procedures by which both 
the firm and its counterparties can bring lawsuits on the contracts entered into 
in the name of the firm. Corporations are subject to rules that make such suits 
easy to bring  as a procedural matter. In particular, they eliminate any need to 
name, or serve notice on, the firm’s individual owners —procedures that 
plagued  the Anglo -Americ an partnership until the late nineteen th century.  
The outcomes achieved by each of these three  types of rules —entity 
shielding, authority, and procedure —require dedicated legal doctrines to be 
effective in the sense that, absent such doctrine s, they could not be replicated 
simply by contracting among a business’s owners and their suppliers and 
customers. That is, the law here serves to reduce the costs of doing business. 
Entity shielding doctrine is needed to create common expectations, among a 
firm and its various present and potential creditors, concerning the effect that a 
contract between a firm  and one of its creditors will have on the security 
available to the firm’s other creditors.24 Rules governing the allocation of

111 MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW 715 (2013).  
22  Armour and Whincop, note 12, at 441–2. 
23 Associated rules —such as the doctrine of ultra vires —may also prescribe limits as to the 
extent to which managers may  bind the company in contract.  
24 To establish the priority of business creditors by contract, a firm’s owners would have to 
contrac t with its business creditors to include subordination provisions, with respect to 
business assets, in all contracts between individual owners and individual creditors. Not only 
would such provisions be cumbersome to draft and costly to monitor, but they w ould be 
subject to a high degree of moral hazard —an individual owner could breach her promise to 
subordinate the claims of he r personal creditors on the firm’s assets with impunity, since this "
" 
 authority are needed to establish common expectations as to who has 
authority to transfer rights relating to corporate assets prior to  entering into a 
contract for their transfer.25 And procedures for lawsuits need to be specified 
by the state, whose third -party authority is invoked by those procedures. This 
need for special rules of law distinguishes these three types of rules from  the 
other basic elements of the corporate form discussed here, almost all of which 
could in theory be crafted by contract even if the law did not provide for a 
standard form of enterprise organization that embodies them.26 
The concept of the ‘separate lega l personality’ of the corporation, as 
understood in the legal literature, is in our terms a convenient heuristic formula 
for describing organizational forms which enjoy the benefit of each of the three 
foregoing ‘foundational’ rule types. Starting from the  premise that the company 
is itself a person, in the eyes of the law, it is straightforward to deduce that it 
should be capable of entering into contracts and owning its own property; 
capable of delegating authority to agents; and capable of suing and bein g sued 
in its own name. For expository convenience, we use the term ‘legal 
personality’ to refer to organizational forms —such as the corporation —that 
share these three attributes. However, we should make clear that legal 
personality in the lawyer’s sense i s not in itself an attribute that is a necessary 
precondition for the existence of any —or indeed all —of these rules,27 but 
merely a handy label for a package that conveniently bundles them together. 
Although it is common in the legal literature to extend sy llogistic deduction 
from the premise of legal personality to the existence of other characteristics of 
‘personhood’ beyond the three foundational features we have described in this 
section , such as ethnicity,28 or the protected enjoyment of civil rights,29 we see 
no functional rationale that compels this.  
1.2.2  Limited liability   
The corporate form effectively provides  a default term in contracts between a 
firm and its creditors whereby the creditors are limited to making claims 
against assets that are held i n the name of ( or ‘owned by’) the firm itself, and 
                                                                                                                                                                      
promise would be unenforceable against personal creditors who w ere not party to the 
bargain. See Hansmann and Kraakman, note  13, at 407 –9. 
25 To leave questions of authority to be determined simply by agreement between the owners 
of the firm will make it costly for parties wishing to deal with the firm to discover whether 
authority has in fact been granted in relation to any particular tr ansaction. Authority rules must 
therefore trade off contracting parties’ ‘due diligence’ costs against preserving flexibility for 
owners to customize their  allocations of authority. See Armour and Whincop, note 12, at 442 –
7. 
26 See Hansmann and Kraakman, note  13, at 407 –9. The exception is limited shareholder 
liability to corporate tort victims. See Section  1.2.2.  
27 Thus, a common law partnership, which is commonly said by lawyers to lack legal 
personality, can under English law enjoy each of the three foundational features described in 
this section: see §§ 31, 33, 39 Partnership Act 1890 (UK); Armour and Whincop, note 12, at 
460–1; Burnes v. Pennell  (1849) 2 HL Cas 497,  521; 9 ER 1181, 1191; PD 7 A, para. 5A Civil 
Procedure Rules (UK).

 have no claim against assets that the firm’s shareholders hold in their own 
names. While t his rule of ‘limited liability’ was not , historically, always 
associated with the corporate form ,30 the association has over time become 
nearly universal . This evolution indicates strongly the value of limited liability as 
a contracting tool and financing device.  
Limited liability shields the firm’s owners —the shareholders —from 
creditors’ claims. Importantly, this facil itates diversification .31 With unlimited 
liability, the downside risk borne by shareholders depends on the way the 
business is carried on. Shareholders will therefore generally prefer to be 
actively involved in the running of the business, to keep this risk  under control. 
This need to be ‘hands -on’ makes investing in multiple businesses difficult. 
Limited liability, by contrast, imposes a finite cap on downside losses, making 
it feasible for shareholders to diversify their holdings.32 It lowers the aggregate 
risk of shareholders’ portfolios, reducing the risk premium they will demand, 
and so lowers the firm’s cost of equity capital.    
The ‘owner shielding’ provided by limited liability is the converse of the 
‘entity shielding’ described above as a component o f legal personality.33 Entity 
shielding protects the assets of the firm from the creditors of the firm’s 
owners, while limited liability protects the assets of the firm’s owners from the 
claims of the firm’s creditors. Together, these forms of asset shieldi ng (or  
‘asset partitioning’ ) ensure that business assets are pledged as security to 
business creditors, while the personal assets of the business’s owners are 
reserved for the owners’ personal creditors.34 As c reditors of the firm 
commonly have a comparativ e advantage in evaluating and monitoring the 
value of the firm’s assets , and  an owner’s personal creditors are likely to have 
a comparative advantage in evaluating and monitoring the individual’s 
personal assets , such asset shielding can reduce the overall  cost of capital to 
the firm and its owners.  It also permits firms to isolate different lines of 
                                                           
30 For example, limited liability was not a standard feature of the English law of joint stock 
companies until the mid -nineteen th century, and in California, shareholders bore unlimited 
perso nal liability for corporation obligations until 1931. See , e.g., Paul L. Davies, GOWER AND 
DAVIES ’ PRINCIPLES OF MODERN COMPANY LAW 40–6 (6th ed. 1997); Phillip Blumberg, Limited 
Liability and Corporate Groups , 11 JOURNAL OF CORPORATE LAW 573 (1986).

REVIEW  259, 262 (1967).   
32 ‘Unlimited liability’ would ordinarily be joint and several amongst business owners. In terms 
of the incentives discussed in the text, a form of liabilit y that  is imposed pro rata  to the number 
of shares held —but without pre -agreed limitation —falls somewhere between this and the 
case of fully limited liability. Shareholders with pro rata  liability can reduce their downside 
exposure either by holding only a small  stake —hence facilitating diversification —or by 
exerting control over the way the business is run: see Hansmann and Kraakman, note  20.  
33 Hansmann, Kraakman, and Squire, note  13. Owner shielding established by a rule of 
limited liability is less fundamental than entity shielding, in the se nse that it can be achieved 
by contract, without statutory fiat.  
34 By ‘c reditors’ we mean here all persons who have a contractual claim on the firm, including 
employees, suppliers, and customers.  "
" 
 business —and focus creditors’ monitoring efforts accordingly —by 
incorporating separate subsidiaries.35 
We should emphasize that, when we refer to limited liabil ity, we mean 
specifically limited liability in contract —that is, limited liability to creditors who 
have contractual claims on the corporation. The compelling reasons for limited 
liability in contract generally do not extend to limited liability to persons  who 
are unable to adjust the terms on which they extend credit to the corporation, 
such as third parties who have been injured as a consequence of the 
corporation’s negligent behavior. Limited liability to such persons is arguably 
not a necessary feature of the corporate form, and perhaps not even a 
socially valuable one, as we discuss more thoroughly in Chapter 5.  
1.2.3  Transferable shares  
Fully transferable shares in ownership are yet another basic characteristic of 
the business corporation that distinguishes the corporation from the 
partnership and various other standard -form legal entities. Transferability 
permits the  firm to conduct business uninterruptedly as the identity of its 
owners changes, thus avoiding the complications of member withdrawal that 
are common among, for example, partnerships, cooperatives, and mutuals.36 
This in turn enhances the liquidity of share holders’ interests and makes it 
easier for shareholders to construct and maintain diversified investment 
portfolios.  
Transferability of shares is the flipside of the liquidation protection that 
the corporation’s legal personality assures to its contractual  counterparties. 
Precisely because counterparties can be confident that the ‘bundle of 
contracts’ that constitutes the firm will be kept together, there is no need for a 
rule requiring owners to continue to participate. In the absence of a legal 
entity —that is, if the owner contracts as sole proprietor —then counterparties 
would be concerned that assignment of their contracts would reduce the value 
of their expected performance and hence wish to restrict it. It is precisely for 
these reasons that all jurisdi ctions have a default rule prohibiting the 
assignment of most contracts without the prior consent of the other 
contracting party. At the same time, however, these consent requirements 
make it more difficult for the owner to sell the business and liquidate her 
investment. Legal personality addresses these problems by enabling the 
simultaneous transfer of all, but no less than all, of a firm’s contracts by 
transferring the corporation’s shares. In other words, it permits the free 
transferability of all of a f irm’s contracts taken together (‘bundle assignability’), 
while preserving the general default rule that makes individual contracts non -
assignable without consent of the contractual counterparty.37  
                                                           
35  Of course, asset shielding through group structures can also be used to reduce 
transparency as to the location of assets. This co ncern underlies an important part of 
corporate law’s creditor -oriented rules: see Chapter  5.2.1.2.  
36 See Henry Hansmann, THE OWNERSHIP OF ENTERPRISE  152–5 (1996).  
37 Ayotte and Hansmann, note 21. To be sure, the parties to indi vidual contracts may —and at 
times do —opt out of such a general rule of bundle assignability by requiring counterparty 
consent in the event of a change of control of the firm.  "
" 
 Fully transferable shares do not necessarily mean freely tr adable  
shares. Even if shares are transferable, they may not be tradable without 
restriction in public markets, but rather just transferable among limited groups 
of individuals or with the approval of the current shareholders or of the 
corporation. Free tr adability maximizes the liquidity of shareholdings and the 
ability of shareholders to diversify their investments. It also gives the firm 
maximal flexibility in raising capital. For these reasons, all jurisdictions provide 
for free tradability for at least  one class of corporation. However, free 
tradability can also make it difficult to maintain negotiated arrangements for 
sharing control and participating in management. Consequently, all 
jurisdictions also provide mechanisms for restricting transferability . 
Sometimes this is done by means of a separate statute, while other 
jurisdictions simply provide for restraints on transferability as an option under 
a general corporation statute.  
As a matter of terminology, we will refer to corporations with freely 
tradable shares as ‘open’ or ‘public’ corporations, and we will correspondingly 
use the terms ‘closed’ or ‘private’ corporations to refer to corporations that 
have restrictions on the tradability of their shares. In addition to this general 
division, two other  distinctions are important. First, the shares of open 
corporations may be listed for trading on a  stock  exchange, in which case we 
will refer to the firm as a ‘listed’ or ‘publicly traded’ corporation, in contrast to 
an ‘unlisted’ corporation. Second, a c ompany’s shares may be held by a small 
number of individuals whose interpersonal relationships are important to the 
management of the firm, in which case we refer to it as ‘closely held’, as 
opposed to ‘widely held’. It is common to speak, loosely, as if a ll companies 
can be categorized as either ‘public’ or ‘close d’ corporations, bundling these 
distinctions together (and the wide ly used term ‘close corporation’ itself 
embodies this ambiguity, being used sometimes to mean ‘closed corporation’, 
sometimes to mean ‘closely held corporation’, and sometimes to mean both). 
But not all companies with free ly tradable shares in fact have widely held 
share ownership, or are listed on s tock exchanges. Conversely, it is common 
in some jurisdictions to find corporations which, though their  shares are not 
freely tradable , have hundreds or thousands of shareholders, and 
consequently have little in common with a typical closely held corporation that 
has only a handful of shareholders, some or all of whom are from the same 
family. 
Transferability of shares, as we have already suggested, is closely 
connected both with the liquidation protection that is a feature of strong form 
legal personality, and with limited liability. Absent either of these featur es, the 
creditworthiness o f the firm as a whole could change, perhaps fundamentally, 
as the identity of its shareholders changed. Consequently, the value of shares 
would be difficult for potential purchasers to judge.38 Ensuring a single price for 
shares, independent of the wealth o f the purchaser, permits securities markets 
to aggregate information about the firm’s expected future performance through 
its stock price.39 Moreover , a seller of shares could impose negative or positive

 externalities on his fellow shareholders depending on  the wealth of the person 
to whom he chose to sell. It is there fore not surprising that strong -form legal 
personality, limited liability, and transferable shares tend to go together, and 
are all features of the standard corporate form everywhere. This is i n contrast 
to the conventional general partnership, which lacks all of these features.  
1.2.4  Delegated management with a board structure  
Standard legal forms for enterprise organization differ in their allocation of 
control rights, including the authority to bind the firm to contracts (discussed 
above), the authority to exercise the powers grante d to the firm by its 
contracts, and the authority to direct the uses made of assets owned by the 
firm.40 For example, the default rule s applicable to general partnership forms 
usually grant power to a majority of partners to manage the firm in the 
ordinary course of business , while  more fundamental decisions require 
unanimity. Both aspects of this allocation are unworkable for business 
corporations with numerous and constantly changing owners , because of 
information and coordination costs .41 Consequently, cor porate law typically 
vests principal authority over corporate affairs in a board of directors or similar 
body  that is periodically elected, exclusively or primarily, by the firm’s 
shareholders. More specifically, business corporations are distinguished by a 
governance structure in which all but the most fundamental decisions are 
generally delegated to a board of directors that has four basic features.  
First, the board is, at least as a formal matter, separate from the 
operational managers of the corporation .42 The legal distinction between them 
formally divides all corporate decisions that do not require shareholder 
approval into those requiring approval by the board of directors and those that 
can be made by the firm’s hired officers on their own authority. This formal 
distinction between the board and hired officers facilitates a separation 
between, on the one hand, initiation and execution of business decisions, 
which is the province of hired officers, and on the other hand the monitoring 
                                                           
40 We have already observed that an important precondition for a firm to serve as a nexus for 
contracts is a rule designating, for  the benefit of third parties, the individu als who have 
authority to enter into contracts that bind the firm and its assets ( text accompanying notes  22-
23). Because there is often overlap in pract ice between the scope of such external authority 
and the internal division of power to control assets, the former, unlike the latter, cannot be 
based purely on agreement between participants in the firm, but rather must be designated to 
some degree by rule s of law. The underlying problem being  one of notice to third parties, the 
law governing closely held firms often leaves these matters to be designated at will in the 
firm’s charter, while for widely held (and presumably large) firms, in which it is advant ageous 
to let multiple  shareholders , creditors , and other third parties  know the allocation of authority 
without incurring the cost of reading the charter, the law is generally more rigid in designating 
the allocation of authority.  
41 See Clark, note 7, at 23 -24 and 801 -16; Sofie Cools, The Dividing Line Between 
Shareholder Democracy and Board Auto nomy , 11 EUROPEAN COMPANY AND FINANCIAL LAW 
REVIEW  258, 272 -73 (2014).  
42 The nature of this separation varies according to whether th e board has one or two tiers. In 
two-tier boards, top corporate officers occupy the board’s second (managing) tier, but are 
generally absent from the first (supervisor) tier, which is at least nominally independent from 
the firm’s hired officers (i.e. from  the firm’s senior managerial employees, though employees 
may sit in the codetermind supervisory boards). See Chapter  3.1. "
" 
 and ratification o f decisions, and the hiring of the officers themselves, which 
are the province of the board. That separation serves as a useful check on the 
quality of decision -making by hired officers.43  
Second, the board of a corporation is elected —at least in substanti al 
part—by the firm’s shareholders. The obvious utility of this approach is to help 
assure that the board remains responsive to the interests of the firm’s owners, 
who bear the costs and benefits of the firm’s decisions and whose interests, 
unlike those of  other corporate constituencies, are not strongly protected by 
contract. This requirement of an elected board distinguishes the corporate 
form from other legal forms, such as nonprofit corporations or business trusts, 
which permit or require a board struct ure, but do not require election of the 
board by the firm’s (beneficial) owners.  
Third, though largely or entirely chosen by the firm’s shareholders, the 
board is formally distinct from them. This separation economizes on the costs 
of decision -making by av oiding the need to inform the firm’s ultimate owners 
and obtain their consent for all but the most fundamental decisions regarding 
the firm. It also permits the board to serve as a mechanism for protecting the 
interests of minority shareholders and other c orporate constituencies, in ways 
we explore in Chapter 4.  
Fourth, the board ordinarily has multiple members. This structure —as 
opposed, for example, to a structure concentrating authority in a single 
trustee, as in many private trusts —facilitates mutual mo nitoring and checks 
idiosyncratic decision -making. However, there are exceptions. Many 
corporation statutes permit business planners to dispense with a collective 
board in favor of a single general director or one -person board44—the evident 
reason being tha t, for a very small corporation, most of the board’s legal 
functions, including its service as shareholder representative and focus of 
liability, can be discharged effectively by a single elected director who also 
serves as the firm’s principal manager.  
1.2.5 Investor ownership  
There are two key elements in the ownership of a firm, as we use the term 
‘ownership’ here: the right to control the firm, and the right to receive the firm’s 
net earnings. The law of business corporations is principally designed to 
facilitate the organization of investor -owned firms —that is, firms in which both 
elements of ownership are tied to investment of equity capital in the firm. More 
specifically, in an investor -owned firm, both the right to participate in control —
which genera lly involves voting in the election of directors and voting to 
approve major transactions —and the right to receive the firm’s residual 
earnings, or profits, are typically proportional to the amount of capital 
                                                           
43 See Eugene Fama and Michael Jensen, Agency Problems and Residual Claims , 26 
JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS 327 (1983).  
44 This is true  not only of most statutes designed principally for private  corporations, suc h as 
France’s SARL (Art. L. 223 -18 Code de commerce ) and SAS (Art. L. 227 -6 Code de 
commerce) and Germany’s GmbH (§ 6 GmbH -Gesetz), but also of the general corporate laws 
in the U K (§ 154(1) Companies Act 2006), Italy (Art . 2380 –II Civil Code), and the U.S. state of 
Delaware,  § 141(b) Delaware General Corporation Law.  "
" 
 contributed to the firm. Business corporation s tatutes generally  provide for this 
allocation of control and earnings as the default rule.45 
There are other forms of ownership that play an important role in 
contemporary economies, and other bodies of organizational law —including 
other bodies of corporate  law—that are specifically designed to facilitate the 
formation of those other types of firms.46 For example, cooperative 
corporation statutes —which provide for all of the four features of the corporate 
form just described except for transferable shares, an d often permit the latter 
as an option as well —allocate voting power and shares in profits 
proportionally to acts of patronage, which may be the amount of inputs 
supplied to the firm (in the case of a producer cooperative), or the amount of 
the firm’s prod ucts purchased from the firm (in the case of a consumer 
cooperative).  
The facilitation of investor ownership became a feature of the corporate 
form only in the second half of the nineteenth century. Until then, both investor 
and consumer owned firms world wide had been routinely organized under a 
single corporate form.47 The subsequent specialization toward investor 
ownership follow ed from the dominant role that investor -owned firms have 
come to play in contemporary economies, and the consequent advantages o f 
having a form that is specialized to the particular needs of such firms, and that 
signals clearly to all interested parties the particular character of the firm with 
which they are dealing. The dominance of investor ownership among large 
firms, in turn, reflects several conspicuous efficiency advantages of that form. 
One is that, among the various participants in the firm, investors are often the 
most difficult to protect simply by contractual means.48 Another is that 
investors of capital have (or, through  the design of their shares, can be 
induced to have) relatively homogeneous interests among themselves, hence 
reducing —though definitely not eliminating —the potential for costly conflict 
among those who share governance of the firm.49 
Specialization to inve stor ownership is yet another respect in which the 
law of business corporations differs from the law of partnership. The 
partnership form typically does not presume that ownership is tied to 
contribution of capital, and though it is often used in that fash ion, it is also 
commonly employed  to assign ownership of the firm in whole or in part to 
contributors of labor or of other factors of production —as in partnerships of 
lawyers and other service professionals, or simply in the prototypical two -
                                                           
45 For a recently enacted rule providing for a different default (double voting rights for long er 
term shareholders in French listed corporations ), see Chapter  4.1.1. 
46 For a discussion of the varieties of forms of ownership found in contemporary economies, 
of their respective economic roles, and of the relationship between these forms and the 
different bodies of organi zational law that govern them, see Hansmann, note 36.

" 
 person partner ship in which one partner supplies labor and the other capital. 
As a consequence, the business corporation is less flexible than the 
partnership in terms of assigning ownership. To be sure, with sufficient 
special contracting and manipulation of the form, ownership  of shares in a 
business corporation can be granted to contributors of labor or other factors 
of production, or in proportion to consumption of the firm’s services. 
Moreover, as the corporate form has evolved, it has achieved greater 
flexibility i n assigning ownership, either by permitting greater deviation from 
the default rules in the basic corporate form (e.g., through restrictions on 
share ownership or transfer), or by developing a separate and more 
adaptable form for close d corporations. Never theless, the default rules of 
corporate law continue to be  generally designed for investor ownership, and 
deviation from this pattern can be awkward . The complex arrangements for 
sharing rights to earnings, assets, and control between entrepreneurs and 
investors in high -tech start -up firms are a good example.50 
There has been further specialization even amongst investor -owned 
companies, with the recent emergence of special forms of ‘public benefit’ or 
‘community interest’ corporations designed to accommodate  the needs of 
hybrid firms that, while investor owned, also commit to the pursuit of a 
specified social objective.51 In other instances, state -owned enterprises 
(SOEs) embrace the corporate form, hence permitting the government to 
share ownership with priva te investors.Because the state is seldom, if ever, a 
typical financial investor, state ownership entails a degree of heterogeneity in 
the shareholder base that exceeds that of the typical investor -owned firm, 
with potential for unique conflicts of interest .52 Sometimes core corporate law 
itself deviates from the assumption of investor ownership to permit persons 
other than investors of capital —for example, creditors or employees —to 
participate in either control or profit -sharing, or both. Worker codeterminat ion 
is a conspicuous example. The wisdom and means of providing for such non -
investor participation in firms that are otherwise investor -owned remains one 
of the central  controversies in corporate law , which w e address further in 
Chapter 4.  
Most jurisdicti ons also have one or more statutory forms —such as the 
U.S. nonprofit corporation, the civil law foundation, and the UK company 
limited by guarantee —that provide for formation of nonprofit firms. These are 
firms in which no person may participate simultaneo usly in both the right to 
control and the right to residual earnings (which is to say, the firms have no 
owners). While nonprofit organizations, like cooperatives, are sometimes 
labelled ‘corporations’, however, they will not be within the specific focus o f

around the world are organized as nonprofits .53 Thus, when we use the term 
‘corporation’ in this book, we refer only to the business corporation, and not to 
cooperative corporations, n onprofit corporations, municipal corporations, or 
other types of incorporated entities. When there is potential for ambiguity, we 
will explicitly use the term ‘business corporation’ to make specific reference to

1.3 Sources of Corporate Law  
All jurisdictions with well -developed market economies have a t least one core 
statute that establishes a basic corporate form with the five characteristics 
described above, and that is designed particularly to permit the formation  of 
public corporations. Nevertheless, corporate law as we understand it here —in 
functional terms —generally extends well beyond the bounds of this core 
statute.  
1.3.1  Special and partial corporate forms  
First, major jurisdictions commonly have at least one  distinct statutory 
form specialized for the formation of closed corporations  or limited liability 
companies . These forms —including the Brazilian Ltda, the French SARL, the 
German GmbH, the  Italian Srl, the Japanese godo kaisha , the American 
limited liabil ity company, and the UK private company54—typically exhibit  
most  of the canonical features of the corporate form. They differ from open , 
or ‘public’,  companies chiefly because their shares, though generally 
transferable at least  in principle, are presumed —and in some cases 
required —not to trade freely in a public market. Sometimes these forms also 
permit departure from one of our five core characteristics —delegated 
management —by permitting elimination of the board in favor of direct 
management by shareholde rs.55 The statutes creating these forms also 
commonly permit, and sometimes facilitate, special allocations of control, 
earnings rights, and rights to employment among shareholders that go 
beyond those permitted in the core public corporation statute.  
Secon d, some jurisdictions have, in addition to these special closed 
corporation forms, quasi -corporate statutory forms that can be used to form 
business corporations with all of our five core characteristics, though some of 
these characteristics must be added by contract. One example is the limited 
liability partnership, which has recently been added to the forms available in 
the law of the U.S. , Japan  and some European jurisdictions. This form simply 
grafts limited liability onto the traditional general partne rship. U.S. and U.K. 
law now allow a limited partnership to have something close to strong form

Managerial Distance and Virtual Ownership: The Governance of Industrial Foundations ,

statute, but by a range of provisions in a single statute with differential application to public 
and private companies.

 entity shielding (by limiting the rights of partners or their creditors to force 
liquidation).56 Consequently, with appropriate governance provisions in the 
partnership agreement, it is effectively possible to create a closed corporation 
as a limited liability partnership.  
The U.S. statutory business trust  offers another example. It provides 
for strong form legal personality and limited liability, but leaves all e lements of 
internal organization to be specified in the organization’s governing instrument 
(charter), failing even to provide statutory default rules for most such 
matters.57 With appropriate charter provisions, a statutory business trust can 
be made equiv alent to a public corporation, with the trust’s beneficiaries in the 
role of shareholders.  
The analysis we offer in this book extends to all these special and 
quasi -corporate forms insofar as they display most or all of the core corporate 
characteristics . Although we make occasional reference to some of these 
forms to underscore certain peculiarities, the description of our core 
jurisdictions’ corporate laws in Chapters 3 to 9 focuses mainly on public 
corporations . 
1.3.2  Other bodies of law  
There are bodies  of law that, at least in some jurisdictions, are 
contained  in statutes or case law that are separate from the core corporation 
statutes, and from the special and quasi -corporation statutes just described, 
but that are nonetheless instrumental to the funct ioning of the five core 
characteristics of the corporate form or to addressing the corporate agency 
problems we describe in Chapter 2 . Hence , we view them functionally as part 
of corporate law.  
To begin, the German law of groups, or Konzernrecht,  qualifies  limited 
liability and limits the discretion of boards of directors in corporations  that are 
closely related through c ommon  ownership, seeking to protect the creditors 
and minority shareholders of corporations with controlling shareholders. 
Although the Konzernrecht —touched upon  in more detail in Chapters 5 and 
6—is embodied in statutory law that is formally distinct from the corporation 
statutes  and case law , it is clearly an integral part of German corporate law. 
Similarly, the statutory rules in many jur isdictions that require employee 
representation on a corporation’s board of directors —such as, conspicuously, 
the German law of codetermination —qualify as elements of corporate law, 
even though they occasionally originate outside the principal corporate la w 
statutes, because they impose a detailed structure of employee participation 
on the boards of directors of large corporations.  
Securities laws in many jurisdictions, including conspicuously the U.S., 
have strong effects on corporate governance through ru les mandating 
disclosure ,58 and sometimes regulating sale and resale of corporate 
                                                           
56 See Hansmann, Kraakman and Squire, note  13, at 1391 –4. 
57 It differs from the common law private trust, from which it evolved, principally in providing 
unambiguously for limited liability for the trust’s beneficiaries even if they exercise control.

 securities, mergers and acquisitions, and corporate elections. Stock exchange 
rules, which can regulate numerous aspects of the internal affairs of 
exchange -listed firms, can also serve as an additional source of corporate 
law, as can other forms of self -regulation, such as the UK’s City Code on 
Takeovers and Mergers.59 These supplemental sources of law are necessarily 
part of the overall structure of corporate law, and we shall  be concerned here 
with all of them.  
There are many constraints imposed on companies by bodies of law 
designed to serve objectives that are, in general, independent of the form 
taken by the organizations they affect. While we will not explore these bodies 
in general, we will discuss th ose that have important effects on corporate 
structure and conduct . Bankruptcy law —or ‘insolvency law’, as it is termed in 
some jurisdictions —is an example. Bankruptcy effects a shift in the ownership 
of the firm from one grou p of investors to another —from shareholders to 
creditors. By providing creditors with an ultimate sanction against defaulting 
firms, it casts a shadow over firms’ relations with their creditors, and affects 
the extent to which creditors may need generalize d protections in corporate 
law. We thus consider the role of bankruptcy law in Chapter 5. Tax law also 
affects directly the internal governance of corporations at various points; the 
U.S. denial of deductibility from corporate income, for tax purposes, of 
executive compensation in excess of $1 million unless it is in the form of 
incentive pay, discussed in Chapter 3, is a clear example.60 And, beyond 
providing for board representation of employees, labor law in some 
countries —as emphasized in Chapter 4 —involves employees or unions in the 
corporate decision -making process, as in requirements that works councils or 
other workers’ organs be consulted prior to taking specified types of actions.  
1.4 Law versus Contract in Corporate Affairs  
The relationships among the participants in a corporation are, to an important 
degree, contractual. The principal contract that binds them is the corporation’s 
charter  (or ‘articles of association’ or ‘constitution ’, as it is termed in some 
jurisdictions). The charter sets out the basic terms of the relationship among 
the firm’s shareholders, and between the shareholders and the firm’s directors 
and other managers.61 By explicit or implicit reference, the charter can  also 
become part of the contract between the firm and its employees or creditors. 
One or more shareholders’ agreements  may, in addition,  bind s ome or all of a 
corporation’s shareholders.  
                                                           
59 We term such self -regulation a source of ‘law’ in part because it is commonly supported, 
directly or indirectly, by law in the narrow sense. The self -regulatory authority of the American 
stock exchanges, for example, is both reinforced and constrained by the U.S. Securities 
Exchange Act and the administrative rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission under that Act. Similarly, the authority of the UK’s Takeover Panel was 
supported indirectly until 2006 by the recognition that if its rulin gs were not observed, formal 
regulation would follow. Since then, it has enjoyed formal statutory authority (Part 28 
Companies Act 2006 (UK)), and so is no longer, strictly speaking, ‘self -regulatory’.  
60 § 162(m) Internal Revenue Code (U.S.).  
61 The charter may be supplemented by a separate set of bylaws, which commonly govern 
less fundamental matters and are subject to different —generally more flexible —amendment 
rules than is the charter.  "
" 
 At the same time, corporations are the subject of a large body of 
statutory law. That body of law is the principal focus of this book. Before 
examining the details of that law, however, we must address a fundamental —
and surprisingly difficult —question: What role does this law play? As we have 
already seen, with few excepti ons, the defining elements of the corporate form 
could in theory be established simply by contract. And the same is true of 
most of the other rules of law that we examine throughout this book. If those 
rules of law did not exist, the relationships they est ablish could still be created 
by means of contract, just by placing similar provisions in the organization’s 
charter. Indeed, t his was the approach taken by the numerous unincorporated 
joint stock companies  formed in England during the eighteenth and early  
nineteen th centuries, before incorporation became widely available in 1844. 
Those companies obtained their legal personality from partnership and trust 
law, and created the rest of their corporate structure —including limited 
liability —by means of contract .62 Why, then, do we today have, in every 
advanced economy, elaborate statutes providing numerous detailed rules for 
the internal governance of corporations?  
1.4.1 Mandatory laws versus default provisions  
In addressing this question, it is important to dist inguish between legal 
provisions that are merely default rules, in the sense that they govern only if 
the parties do not explicitly provide for something different, and laws that are 
mandatory, leaving parties no option but to conform to them.63 
A significa nt part of corporate law —more in some jurisdictions, less in 
others —consists of default provisions.64 To this extent, corporate law simply 
offers a standard form contract that the parties can adopt, at their option, in 
whole or in part. A familiar advantage  of such a legally provided standard form 
is that it saves costs —specifically, it simplifies contracting among the parties 
involved  by requiring that they specify only those elements of their relationship 
that deviate from the standard terms. Corporate law ’s provision of such 
standard terms as default is thereby seen in economic terms as a ‘public 
good’. Default provisions can serve this function best if they are ‘majoritarian’ 
in content —that is, if they reflect the terms that the majority of well -informed  
parties would themselves most commonly choose.65 
Default provisions can be supplied in a variety of ways, the choice of 
which affects the ease and means of ‘contracting around’ them.66 A common

the parties stipulating something else.  
65 Easterbrook and Fischel, note  7, at 34 –5. 
66 The ease with which parties can ‘contract around’ a default provision will affect the way it 
operates. For a nuanced discussion of these and other issues, see Ian Ayres, Regulating Opt -
Out: An Economic Theory of Altering Rules , 121 YALE LAW JOURNAL  2032 (2012). For an 
empirical perspective, see Yair Listoki n, What do Corporate Default Rules and Menus Do? An 
Empirical Examination , 6 JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL LEGAL STUDIES  279 (2009).  "

 form of corporate law default is a statutory provision that wil l govern unless 
the parties explicitly provide an alternative. The common provision that each 
share carries one vote  is an example. A charter clause  can deviate from that 
default by, for instance, providing for the issuance of a class of stock carrying 
no voting right . 
Alternatively, corporate law itself sometimes specifies the rule that will 
govern if the default provision is not chosen —an ‘either -or’ provision. An 
example is offered by French corporate law, which allows companies’ charters 
to opt for a tw o-tier board structure as an alternative to the default single -tier 
one.67 In other words, the law in this case gives the corporation a choice 
between two statutory provisions : one is the default and the other is the 
‘secondary’ provision, with the latter a pplying only if the firm opts out of the 
default (or, equivalently, ‘opts in’ to the secondary provision). The law may 
also impose special procedures for altering a default rule , such as by requiring 
minority approval to alter default rules that protect th eir interests .68 An 
extension of the binary two -alternative -provisions approach just described is 
to provide corporations with a choice among a ‘menu’ of more than two 
specified rules.69  
There are also important rules of corporate law that are mandatory.70 
Large German corporations, for example, have no alternative but to give half 
of their supervisory board seats to representatives of their employees, and 
publicly traded U.S. corporations have no alternative but to provide regular 
detailed financial disclosu re in a closely prescribed format.71 The rationale for 
mandatory terms of these types is usually based on some form of ‘contracting 
failure’: some parties might otherwise be exploited because they are not well 
informed; the interests of third parties might be affected; or collective action 
problems might otherwise lead to contractual provisions that are inefficient or 
unfair.72 Mandatory terms may also serve a useful standardizing function, in 
circumstances (such as with accounting rules) where the benefits o f 
compliance increase if everyone adheres to the same provision.  
Mandatory rules need not just serve a prescriptive function, however. 
When used in conjunction with a choice of corporate forms , they can perform 
an enabling function similar to that served b y default rules. More particularly, 
mandatory rules can facilitate freedom of contract by helping corporate actors 
to signal the terms they offer and to bond themselves to those terms. The law 
accomplishes this by creating corporate forms that are to some degree 
inflexible (i.e., are subject to mandatory rules), but then permitting choice

 among different corporate forms.73 There are two principal variants to this 
approach.  
First, a given jurisdiction can provide for a menu of different standard 
form legal en tities from which parties may choose in structuring an 
organization. In some U.S. jurisdictions, for example, a firm with the five basic 
attributes of the business corporation can be formed, alternatively, under a 
general business corporation statute, a cl ose corporation statute, a limited 
liability company statute, a limited liability partnership statute, or a business 
trust statute —with each statute providing a somewhat different set of 
mandatory and default rules . Second, even with respect to a particula r type of 
legal entity, such as the publicly traded business corporation, the organizers 
of a firm may often choose among different jurisdictions’ laws. This leads us to 
the general issue of choice of law and the related debate about ‘regulatory 
competitio n’ in corporation law. Before addressing that topic, however, we 
need to say more about the role of corporation law in general.  
1.4.2 The benefits of legal rules  
Default rules of corporate law do more than simply provide convenient 
standard forms, encourage revelation of information, and facilitate choice of 
the most efficient among several alternative rules. They also provide a means 
of accommodating, over time, developments that cannot easily be foreseen at 
the outset.  
A contract that, like a corporation’s charter, must govern complex 
relationships over a long period of time, is  necessarily incomplete . Situations 
will arise for which t he contract fails to provide clear guidance, either because 
the situation was not foreseeable at the time the contract was drafted or 
because the situation, though foreseeable, seemed too unlikely to justify the 
costs of making clear provision for it in th e contract. Statutory amendments, 
administrative rulings, and judicial decisions can provide for such situations as 
they arise, by either altering  or interpreting existing rules. This is the gap-filling  
role of corporation law.  
Courts play a key role in filling gaps, simply by interpreting privately  
drafted contractual terms in a corporation’s charter. A firm will get the greatest 
advantage from the courts’ interpretive activity if it adopts standard charter 
terms used by many other firms, since those stand ard terms are likely to be 
subject to repeated interpretation by the courts.74 And the most wide ly used 
standard charter terms are often the default rules embodied in the corporation 
law. So , another advantage of sticking to the  default provision s, rather t han 
drafting specialized charter terms, is to benefit from  the constant gap -filling 
activity stimulated by the body of precedents developed as a result of other

" 
 corporations that are also subject to those rules.75 This is one example of a 
network effect  that creates an incentive to choose a common approach.76 
The problem of contractual incompleteness goes beyond mere gap -
filling, however. Given the long lifespan of many corporations, it is likely that 
some of a firm’s initial charter terms, no matter how care fully chosen, will 
become obsolete with the passage of time owing to changes in the economic 
and legal environment. Default rules of law have the feature that they are 
altered over time —by statutory amendments and by judicial interpretation —to 
adapt them t o such changing circumstances. Consequently, by adopting a 
statutory default rule, a firm has a degree of assurance that the provision will 
not become anachronistic. If, in contrast, the firm puts in its charter a special ly 
drafted provision in place of th e statutory default, only the firm itself can 
amend the provision when, over time, a change is called for. This runs into the 
problem that the firm’s own mechanisms for charter amendment may be 
vetoed or hijacked by particular constituencies in order, resp ectively, to 
protect or further their partial interests. Simply adopting the statutory default 
rules, and delegating to the state the responsibility for altering those rules 
over time as circumstances change, avoids these latter problems.77 
It follows from much of the foregoing that, for many corporations, there 
may often be little practical difference between mandatory and default rules. 
Firms end up, as a practical matter, adopting default rules as well as the 
mandatory rules. The most empirically signific ant dimensions of selection lie 
in the abilit y of participants to select from a range of different business 
forms —which we have discussed —and of corporations to choose the 
jurisdiction by whose corporation law they will be governed, which is the 
subject to  which we turn next.  
1.4.3 Choice of legal regime  
The various forms of flexibility in corporate law on which we have so far 
concentrated —the choice of special ly drafted charter provisions versus 
default provisions, the choice of one default rule in a given statute as opposed 
to ano ther, and the choice of one statutory form versus another —can all be 
provided within any given jurisdiction. As we have noted, however, there can 
be yet another dimension of choice —namely, choice of the jurisdiction in 
which to incorporate.  
In the United S tates, for example, the prevailing choice of law rule for 
corporate law is the ‘place of incorporation’ rule, which permits a business 
corporation to be incorporated under —and hence governed by —the law of 
                                                           
75 Klausner, note 69, at 826-29. 
76 A related network effect that may encourage firms to adopt standardized charter terms,  
and in particular to accept default rules of law, is that those provisions are more famil iar to 
analysts and investors, thus reducing their costs of evaluating the firm as an investment. 
Similar network effects may cause legal services to be less expensiv e for firms that adopt 
default rules of law. See Marcel Kahan and Michael Klausner, Standardization and Innovation 
In Corporate Contracting (or ‘The Economics of Boilerplate’) , 83 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW  713 
(1997).  
77 See Henry Hansmann, Corporation and Contra ct, 8 AMERICAN LAW AND ECONOMICS REVIEW  
1 (2006).  "
" 
 any of the fifty  individual states (or any foreign country), regardless of where 
the firm’s principal place of business, or other assets and activities, are 
located. That form of choice, long available within the United States and in a 
number of other countries as well, has now been largely extende d to 
entrepreneurs  throughout the European Union as a consequence of European 
Court of Justice decisions requiring the domestic recognition of corporations 
formed in other member states adopting the place of incorporation rule .78 
These denied the efficacy of the ‘r eal seat’ doctrine under which, in many 
European countries, firms were formerly required to incorporate under the law 
of the state where the firm had its principal place of business.79  
The consequence of choice a mongst  jurisdictions is not simply  to 
enlarg e the range of governance rules from which a given firm can choose . It 
also create s the opportunity for a jurisdiction to induce firms to incorporate 
under its law —and thereby bring revenue to the state directly (through 
franchise fees) and indirectly (thr ough increased demand for local services) —
by making th at jurisdiction ’s corporate law attractive. This permits the 
emergence of corporate law systems that are driven primarily by market 
forces based on companies’ demand, and less influenced by other politi cal 
forces that typically shape democratic lawmaking.80 Whether such ‘regulatory 
competition’ exists at all —and if it does, whether it is a good thing —has long 
been the subject of vigorous debate.81  Pessimists argue that it creates a ‘race 
to the bottom’ in  which the state that wins is that which goes furthest in 
stripping its law of protections for constituencies who do not control the 
(re)incorporation decision. Optimists argue that, on the contrary, regulatory 
competition in corporate law creates a virtuo us ‘race to the top’ : because the

 capital markets price, more or less accurately, the effects of corporate law  
choice, the state that wins is that whose law maximizes shareholder  welfare.82  
Of course, there is dispute as to what constitutes an ‘optimal’ bo dy of 
corporate law, even in theory —a topic to which we will turn shortly . Yet an 
important benefit associated with the existence of choice  among multiple 
regulatory regimes is that is creates opportunities for regulatory 
experimentation. That is, diverse legal regimes serve as laboratories from 
which regulators and firms can learn more about the merits and drawbacks of 
different modes of regulation.83 Moreover, there is unlikely to be a single 
optimal body of corporate law applicable to all firms, since com panies vary in 
their needs for regulation. Choice among jurisdictions (or statutory menus) 
therefore enables diverse legal regimes to cater to the needs of different types 
of firms.84  While much of the literature on regulatory competition tends to 
assume c orporate law is a single uniform commodity, this is not always what 
we observe in practice.85  
Finally, even if the optimal corporate law regime were uniform and 
known to parties, the existence of dual —or even multiple —regulatory regimes 
might be justified by reference to politics. Reform of inefficient rules may be  
blocked by powerful interests —such as those of managers, controlling 
shareholders or workers —who benefit from the status quo. In such instances, 
framing a reform as voluntary can disable opposit ion by creating a more 
efficient parallel regime which, because it only applies to those who opt into it, 
does not impinge on the entitlements of incumbents. Both the establishment 
of the Novo Mercado premium listing segment in Brazil and certain EU 
measur es such as the creation of the European Company ( Societas 
Europaea —SE) can be interpreted as bypassing the political clout of interest 
groups in existing companies.86

 1.5 What Is the Goal of Corporate Law?  
What is the goal of corporate law, as distinct fro m its immediate functions of 
defining a form of enterprise and containing the conflicts among the 
participants in this enterprise?  As a normative matter, the overall objective of 
corporate law —as of any branch of law —is presumably to serve the 
interests of  society as a whole. More particularly, the appropriate goal of 
corporate law is to advance the aggregate welfare of all who are affected by 
a firm’s activities, including the firm’s shareholders, employees, suppliers, 
and customers, as well as third parti es such as local communities and 
beneficiaries of the natural environment.87 This is what economists would 
characterize as the pursuit of overall social welfare .  
At least in theory, however, the pursuit of overall social welfare may 
be compatible with diff erent immediate goals for corporate law. One view is 
that corporate law best advances social welfare by reducing the costs of 
contracting among the corporation’s contractual constituencies —which 
include not only managers and shareholders but also certain c reditors and 
employees. The underlying assumption is that any externalities that the 
corporation generates are best addressed by regulatory constraints from 
other areas of law. Indeed, legal strategies designed to maximize the value 
of firms adopting the c orporate structure constitute both the lion’s share of 
corporate law as it is generally understood and the primary object of our 
analysis.  
It is sometimes said that the goals of core corporate law should be 
even narrower. In particular, it is sometimes sa id that the appropriate role of 
corporate law is simply to assure that the corporation serves the best interests 
of its shareholders or, more specifically, to maximize financial returns to 
shareholders or, more specifically still, to maximize the current m arket price of 
corporate shares. Such claims can be viewed in two ways.  
First, these claims can be taken at face value, in which case they 
neither describe corporate law as we observe it nor offer a normatively 
appealing aspiration for that body of law. Th ere would be little to recommend 
a body of law that, for example, permits corporate shareholders to enrich 
themselves through transactions that make creditors or employees worse off 
by $2 for every $1 that the shareholders gain.  
Second, such claims can be understood as saying, more modestly, that 
focusing principally on the maximization of shareholder returns is, in general, 
the best means by which corporate law can serve the broader goal of 
advancing overall social welfare. In general, creditors, workers, and 
customers will consent to deal with a corporation only if they expect 
themselves to be better off as a result. Consequently, the corporation —and, in 
                                                           
87 We speak here of maximizing the ‘aggregate welfare ’ of society more as a loose metaphor 
than a precise yardstick. There is no coherent way to put a number on society’s aggregate 
welfare, much less to maximize that number —and particularly so when many benefits are in 
appreciable part non -pecuniary. What we  are suggesting here might be put more precisely in 
the language of welfare economics as pursuing Kaldor -Hicks efficiency within acceptable 
patterns of distribution.  "
" 
 particular, its shareholders, as the firm’s residual claimants88 and risk -
bearers —have a direct pecuniar y interest in making sure that corporate 
transactions are beneficial, not just to the shareholders, but to all parties who 
deal with the firm. We believe that this second view is —and surely ought to 
be—the appropriate interpretation of statements by legal scholars and 
economists asserting that shareholder value is the proper object of corporate 
law. 
We should keep in mind, as well, that to say that shareholder value is 
the principal objective toward which corporations should be managed is not to 
say that th e corporation should maximize pecuniary profits regardless of the 
means employed. In particular, an unappealing implication of the unrestrained 
pursuit of profit is that firms should not take the legal regime as pre -
determined, but instead become actively involved in seeking to relax rules that 
constrain their imposition of externalities.89 Such corporate influence in the 
rule-making process is clearly problematic, and to the extent that regulation is 
consequently compromised, it may be appropriate for corpo rate law to seek to 
modify internal governance arrangements accordingly.90  
How generally the pursuit of shareholder value is an effective means of 
advancing overall social welfare is an empirical question , on which reasonable 
minds can differ. While each o f the authors of this book has individual views 
on this claim, we do not take a strong position on it in the chapters that follow. 
Rather, we undertake the broader task of offering an analytic framework 
within which this question can be explored and debate d. 
Another view is that, given the prominent role of the business 
corporation in the modern economy, corporate law can be harnessed to 
promote social welfare directly through more tailored interventions, for 
example by imposing socially oriented disclosure  obligations or molding the 
corporation’s internal governance arrangements to address broader social 
problems. From this perspective, corporate law may be used to promote  
economic or social objectives beyond maximizing the value of the firm, such 
as reduc ing systemic risk, mitigating gender inequity or protecting the 
environment.91 Although as old as corporate law itself,92 the deployment of 
                                                           
88 Shareholders are a corporation’s ‘residual claimants’ in the sense that they are entitle d to 
appropriate all (and only) the net assets and earnings of the corporation after all contractual 
claimants —such as employees, suppliers, and customers —have been paid in full.

spending is universal: John C. Coates IV, Corporate Politics, Governance, and Value Before

91 By far the most popular means to protect interests external to the firm is through the 
imposition of su bstantive rules or standards  of different stripes  (as those of antitrust law, 
environmental laws, human rights laws, antidiscrimination laws, financial regulation etc.). For 
our purposes, as i n general parlance, the use of legal rules for purposes other than increasing 
the value of the firm is the bounda ry separating corporate from other areas of law . On the use 
of corporate governance to address a variety of economic and social problems, see Mariana 
Pargendler, The Corporate Governance Obsession , 42 JOURNAL OF CORPORATION LAW 101 
(2016).   "

 corporate law to protect the interests of parties external to the firm has found 
renewed favor among lawmakers in the wake of the recent financial crisis. 
We consider some examples of this in Chapter 4, but otherwise concentrate 
on the role of corporate law in maximizing the value of the firm by protecting 
the interests of its contractual constituencies.  
1.6 What Forces S hape Corporate Law?  
To say that the pursuit of aggregate social welfare is the appropriate 
goal of corporate law is not to say, of course, that the law always pursues it in 
the same way . The particular contours of the problems to which corporate law 
respon ds may be, at least in part, determined by other aspects of the 
corporate governance environment —for example, predominant industry type, 
institutions governing employee relations, and the structure of share 
ownership. These may consequently complement particular features of 
corporate law.93  Similarly, other features of the environment —for example, 
the quality of legal institutions —may make certain aspects of corporate law 
more or less effective in performing these functions. In each case, these point 
to par ticular ways in which corporate law can enhance social welfare —the 
selection of which might be termed an ‘efficiency’ effect on corporate law.  
Nor indeed does saying that the pursuit of social welfare is the 
appropriate goal of corporate law imply that co rporate law always does serve 
that goal . Understanding how corporate law comes to pursue particular goals 
is a question of political economy —that is, the political and economic forces 
that shape lawmaking .94 The political economy of corporate law generally 
reflects the interests of influential  constituencies, such as controlling 
shareholders, corporate managers, or organized workers . In the presence of 
competitive markets, these interests often coalesce on welfare -enhancing 
laws, producing the ‘efficiency’ e ffect on corporate law. Yet in some 
circumstances, lawmakers pay undue regard to the interests of particular 
constituencies, a fondness for which might be termed a ‘political’ effect on 
corporate law .  
Another political effect is the phenomenon of populist  reforms after a 
scandal or crisis. In the period after a crisis, lawmakers feel strong pressure 
from the electorate to implement reforms, the content of which is determined 
by what appeals generally, which may be quite different from what will actually 
solve the underlying economic problems.95 The extent to which there is a 
                                                                                                                                                                      
92 See, e.g., Herbert Hovenkamp , ENTERPRISE AND AMERICAN LAW, 1836 -1937 , 63-4 (1991); 
Hansmann and Pargendler, note  47, at 145.  
93 For instance, an educational system that favors vocational and firm -specific training will 
work best under a la bor law regime that protects employees against dismissal and under a 
system of corporate finance that is more relational and immune to short -term oscillations in 
market conditions. Germany traditionally embodied this institutional bundle. In the U.S., by 
contrast, a labor regime of at -will employment favors a more generalist style of education and 
facilitates vibrant capital markets subject to dispersed ownership and hostile takeovers.  See 
Hall and Soskice, note 1.   
94 See, e.g., Mark J. Roe, POLITICAL DETERMINANTS OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  (2003); 
Peter A. Gourevitch and James Shinn,  POLITICAL POWER AND CORPORATE CONTROL  (2005).  
95 See Pepper D. Culpepper, QUIET POLITICS AND BUSINESS POWER  (2011) .  "
" 
 divergence is another political effect on corporate law. C orporate law 
everywhere continues to bear the imprint of the historical path through which it 
has evolved, reflect ing both polit ical and efficiency effects along the way.  
Reforms triggered by the recent financial crisis illustrate both efficiency 
and political concerns. In the immediate aftermath of the crisis, many asked 
whether it did not call into question effectiveness of corp orate law in 
promoting social welfare.96 As the dust settled, it became tolerably clear —at 
least to us —that the implications of the crisis were mostly confined to the 
governance regimes applicable to banks and other financial institutions,97 
which have an un usual degree of interconnection and propensity to contagion . 
Consequently, there are good functional reasons for introducing special 
regimes for bank governance that differ from ordinary business firms. 
However, some post -crisis reforms have been more gene ral in their scope —
which may be understood as reflecting populist political concerns triggered by 
the crisis.98 
We touch here briefly on  perhaps the most conspicuous of the various 
forces that help shape —and, in turn, are shaped by —corporate law : the 
patter n of corporate ownership . The nature and number of corporate 
shareholders differ markedly even among the most developed market 
economies . In recent years, the extent of these differences has lessened, but 
their historic and remaining contours surely leave a mark on the structure of 
corporate law.  Its relevance for our account is twofold: ownership structure 
affects the functionality of different legal strategies, and also the interest group 
dynamics that govern changes in corporate law.  
In the U.S. and the  UK, there are large numbers of publicly traded 
corporations that have dispersed share ownership , such that no single 
shareholder, or affiliated group of shareholders, is capable of exercising 
control over the firm.99 Shareholdings among major Japanese firm s are also 
often highly  dispersed,100 though in the second half of the twentie th century it 
was common for a substantial fraction of a firm’s stock to be held by other 
firms in a loose group with substantial reciprocal cross -shareholdings.101 In

 our other juri sdictions , in contrast, even firms with public ly trading shares have 
traditionally had a controlling shareholder , in the form of another firm  often at 
the top of  a closely coordinated group of other firms,102 individuals, families or 
the state.103  
The types o f entities by or through which  non-controlling stakes  are 
held also differ substantially from one country to another. The U.S. 
traditionally had high levels of ownership by retail investors . In contrast, U.K. 
stock ownership in the late twentieth century w as dominated by institutional 
investors —primarily domestic pension funds and insurance companies.104 In 
Germany, large commercial banks traditionally held substantial blocks of 
shares on their own account, and also served as custodians for large amounts 
of stock owned by individuals, whose votes were often effectively exercised 
by the banks themselves.105  
However, this pattern has changed in recent years. A secular growth in 
assets under management by U.S. institutional investors —principally mutual 
funds  and e mployer -established pension funds106—means their ownership of 
stock now dwarves that of retail investors. This growth has also led U.S. 
institutions to invest in other stock markets around the world. Thus in the U.K. , 
domestic institutions have, since the tu rn of the century, ceded ownership of 
the majority of stock to international investors, thought to be mainly U.S. 
institutions.107 In Germany, many large companies also now have a majority 
of foreign shareholders. And even elsewhere international investors h old a 
substantial chunk of listed companies’ free float. While there is a certain 
degree of convergence in ownership structures across jurisdictions, there is 
arguably greater variance in the shareholding patterns of different firms within 
any given jurisd iction.  
The past two decades have also seen the rise of new types of 
institutional investor. Conspicuous among these are hedge funds  and private 
equity funds. Hedge funds are relatively unregulated collective investment 
                                                           
102 However, there are indications that the traditional position in some jurisdictions, notably 
Germany, is starting to change in favor of more dispersed stock ownership: see Steen 
Thomsen, Convergence of Corporate Governance during the Stock Market Bubble: Towards 
Anglo -American or European Standards? , in CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND FIRM 
ORGANIZATION  297, 306 –12 (Anna Grandori ed ., 2004); Wolf-Georg Ringe, Changing Law and

 funds which , despite their name, of ten adopt highly speculative strategies  
including purchasing  substantial stakes in individual firms,108 and that 
sometimes agitate for major changes in the firms’ structure, strategy, or 
management. P rivate equity firms, in turn, are (typically) investment v ehicles  
that acquire, at least temporarily, control, and then complete ownership of 
formerly public companies to effect major changes in the firms’ structure, 
strategy, or management.109 We have also seen the proliferation of state -
controlled institutional i nvestors, such as sovereign wealth funds.   
Plausibly , differences in patterns of shareholding across countries 
correlate with differences in the structure of corporate law. An influential 
series of empirical studies on ‘law and finance’ reported that, at the end of the 
twentieth century,  countries with greater legal protection for shareholders 
(against opportunism by managers and controlling shareholders ) had less 
concentrated shareholdings ,110 although subsequent studies found the results 
to be sensitive to  the way in which ‘protection’ is measured.111 Such a pattern 
is consistent with both changes in the configuration of interest groups who call 
for changes in corporate laws, and changes in the types of corporate law rules 
that yield functional outcomes.  
To some extent, therefore, the structure of corporate law in any given 
country is a consequence of that country’s pattern of corporate ownership . 
This in turn is determined at least in part by forces exogenous to corporate 
law.112 It has been argued, for example , that the traditionally retail -oriented  
pattern of U.S. shareholdings was a product  of that country’s history  of 
populist politics, which generated  a number of policies successfully designed 
to frustrate family and institutional control of industrial ente rprise.113 
Correspondingly, it is  said that the traditionally more concentrated share 
ownership patterns in continental Europe and Japan complemented particular

 patterns of industrial development.114 On this view , a controlling shareholder 
may, under certain c ircumstances,  be better placed to make credible long -
term commitments to employees, which in turn may facilitate labor relations —
and hence productivity —where the goal is to motivate workers to use existing 
technology, rather than to develop new technologie s.115

law, not about its origins. Nonetheless, in the chapters that follow we will here

ownership structure —and of other  forces  as well —in shaping the patterns of 
corporate law that we see across jurisdictions.
